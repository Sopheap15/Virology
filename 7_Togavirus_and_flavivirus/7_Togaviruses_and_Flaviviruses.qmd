- Arboviruses: spread by arthropod vectors
- Broad host range: vertebrates (mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles) and invertebrates (mosquitoes, ticks)
- Zoonoses: diseases spread by animals or with an animal reservoir

## Structure and replication Alphaviruses (_Togaviridae_) {.smaller}

:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="60%"}
- Genome: (+)ssRNA
- Capsid: icosahedral, envelope
- Slightly > picornaviruses (45-75 nm in diameter)
- 3 structural proteins:
  - Capsid (C) protein encloses viral RNA → nucleocapsid
  - 2 proteins (E1 and E2): glycoproteins → hemagglutinin containing viral spikes
- Genome: encodes early and late proteins

## Structure and replication Flaviviruses  (_Flaviviridae_) {.font14}

:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="60%"}
- Genome: (+)ssRNA
- Capsid: icosahedral, envelope
- Envelope slightly < alphavirus: 40-65 nm diameter
- E viral glycoprotein folds over, pairs up with another E glycoprotein, and lies flat across surface of virion → outer protein layer
- Attachment and penetration: same as alphaviruses

## Arthropod vectors and transmission{.font14}

:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="75%"}
- Arboviruses: bite of an arthropod (mosquito) → course of infection (vertebrate host and invertebrate vector)
- Female mosquitoes → viruses → blood meal → viremic vertebrate host
- Virus → infects epithelial cells midgut mosquito → spreads → circulation → infects salivary glands
- Virus → persistent infection and replicates to high titers in cells
- Salivary glands → release virus → saliva

![](images/image14.png){ width="100%" style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;"}

## Pathogenesis

- Arboviruses cause lytic or persistent infections
- Blocks cellular mRNA from binding to ribosomes
- Increased permeability of target cell membrane and changes in ion concentrations → alter enzyme activities → translation viral mRNA over cellular mRNA
- Alphaviruses: nucleotide triphosphatase → degrades deoxyribonucleotides → depleting DNA production

## Immune response

- Immunity is believed to be permanent after a single infection
- Both humoral antibody and cellular immune responses → protection and recovery from infection
- Build up immunity → inapparent infections
- Antibodies to local arthropod-borne virus increase with age

## Clinical manifestations{.font14}
- Alphavirus: usually asymptomatic or cause low-grade disease, such as flu-like symptoms (chills, fever, rash, and aches)
- Flavivirus: relatively benign, but serious aseptic meningitis and encephalitic or hemorrhagic disease can occur
- Dengue: major worldwide problem, 100 million cases/year
  - Dengue fever: high fever, headache, rash, and back and bone pain
  - Dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF): high-grade continuous fever, hepatomegaly, thrombocytopenia (<100,000/µL), ↑ hematocrit >20%
  - Dengue shock syndrome (DSS): DHF + shock

## Clinical manifestations (cont.)

## Techniques for detection

- Culture: grown in both vertebrate and mosquito cell lines, but most are difficult to isolate
- Detection: cytopathologic studies, immunofluorescence, and hemadsorption of avian erythrocytes
- Detection and characterization can be performed by RT-PCR testing of genomic RNA or viral mRNA in blood or other samples
- Serologic methods: hemagglutination inhibition, ELISA, and latex agglutination

## Techniques for detection (cont.)

- NS1 antigen (0–7 d): detected by lF or ELISA. Sensitivity falls in secondary infections
- IgM antibodies (~4–7 d onward): detected by MAC‑ELISA or rapid serologic tests; indicates recent infection and peaks ~2 weeks. Cross‑reacts with other flaviviruses
- Combined NS1 + IgM testing on days 5–7 maximizes diagnostic yield

## Epidemiology
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="70%"}
- Hosts: mammals, birds, reptiles, insects
- Transmission: arbovirus spread by mosquito bites (Aedes, Culex)
- Geography/Season: vector-dependent; endemic where vectors live, peaks in summer
- Control: eliminate breeding sites and mosquito control; vaccines — yellow fever (live), Japanese encephalitis (inactivated)

## Treatment

- No specific antiviral treatments → supportive care
- Preventing spread: elimination of vectors & breeding grounds
- Vaccines:
  - Live vaccine against yellow fever virus
  - Killed vaccines against EEEV, WEEV, Japanese encephalitis virus, and Russian spring-summer encephalitis virus
  - Dengues: available in some countries but use is limited by regulatory status and safety concerns

**Patient vignette**

28‑year‑old with 3 days of high fever (39.5°C), severe myalgia, retro‑orbital pain, headache, nausea, maculopapular rash, early petechiae. BP 100/70, pulse 100.

**Group instructions**

- Groups of 4 people
- Assign: clinician, scribe, presenter, timekeeper
- 25 minutes discussion + 5 minutes presentation
- Deliverable: 1 slide or 2‑minute summary

**Guide questions**

 1. Which arthropod is the most likely vector? (consider biting behaviour and breeding sites)
 2. How would you control the vector at household and community level?
 3. Which clinical features/signs suggest progression to dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) or shock?
 4. How does the virus invade and spread in the host (early pathogenesis steps)?
 5. Which diagnostic tests would you order at different illness days (0–7, >4, support labs) and why?
 6. How would you manage this patient initially (outpatient vs admit)? What monitoring is essential?
 7. Why should ibuprofen/other NSAIDs (and aspirin) be avoided in suspected dengue?
 8. Which immediate lab results (platelets, hematocrit, NS1/RT‑PCR) would change your management plan?

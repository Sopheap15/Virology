## Introduction
- Host cells supply energy, substrates, and machinery for viral protein synthesis and genome replication
- **6-step replication cycle**: attachment, penetration (entry), uncoating, expression and genome replication (transcription/translation), assembly (maturation), release
- Each step is a potential **antiviral target** (e.g., neuraminidase inhibitors block influenza release)
- Host **susceptibility** and **permissiveness** determine tissue tropism and infection outcome

## One-step viral growth curve

- **Key factors**:
  - Susceptibility: ability of a cell to be infected
  - Permissiveness: ability of a cell to support viral replication
- **Host range**: the set of susceptible cells a virus can infect
- **Replication curve**:
  - **Eclipse period**: from penetration to biosynthesis, ends with the appearance of new virions after assembly
  - **Latent period**: from penetration to release, no extracellular virions detected

## Infection outcomes

**Abortive infection**: no progeny virus produced due to non-permissive cells or defective virus
- Example: _Influenza virus_ in mosquito cells

**Persistent productive infection**: virus gently released through exocytosis or budding
- Example: _Hepatitis C virus_ in hepatocytes

**Latent infection**: viral genome persists without progeny production; can reactivate later
- Example: _Herpes simplex virus_ (HSV) in neurons

**Lytic infection**: host cell death with progeny virus production
- Example: _Poliovirus_ in motor neurons

## Animal virus multiplication steps

1. **Attachment**: virus binds to target cell receptors
2. **Penetration (entry)**: virus enters the cell
3. **Uncoating**: viral genome is released
4. **Expression and Replication**: viral genome is transcribed and replicated
5. **Assembly**: viral components are assembled into new virions
6. **Release**: virions are released from the host cell

## Attachment

- **Mechanism** interaction between viral structures and host cell receptors:
  - **Naked viruses**: use capsid proteins to bind host receptors
  - **Enveloped viruses**: use glycoprotein spikes to bind host receptors
- **Examples**:
  - CD4 T cells → *HIV* (gp120)
  - CD21 B cells → *Epstein-Barr virus*
  - Sialic acid → *Influenza virus*

## Penetration

:::{.columns}
::: {.column width="70%"}
- **Mechanisms**:
  - **Direct fusion**: viral envelope fuses with the host membrane (e.g., *Herpesviridae*)
  - **Endocytosis**: virus enters via endosomes (e.g., *Orthomyxoviridae*)
  - **Bacteriophage injection**: tail fibers is injected into the bacterial cytoplasm

## Uncoating

- Uncoating: destabilizing the capsid and releasing the genome 
  - **DNA viruses**: genome is delivered to the nucleus (except *Poxviridae*)
  - **RNA viruses**: genome remains in the cytoplasm/nucleus
- Example:
  - *Influenza virus*: low pH in endosome triggers uncoating


## Viral protein synthesis{.smaller}
**DNA viruses**:

- Transcription in the nucleus by host RNA polymerase
- mRNA transported to cytoplasm for translation

**RNA viruses**:

- (+sense)RNA: directly translated by host ribosomes
- (-sense)RNA: transcribed to +RNA by viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase
- dsRNA: transcribed to mRNA by viral enzymes before translation

**Retroviruses**:

- Reverse transcribed to DNA by viral reverse transcriptase
- DNA integrates into host genome for transcription and translation

## Assembly
- **Definition**: the process of assembling structural proteins and incorporating the viral genome into the procapsid
  - Simple self-assembly: structural proteins spontaneously form the capsid
  - Proteolytic cleavage or conformational changes finalize the virion structure


## Virus release mechanisms

- **Mechanisms**:
  - **Budding**: enveloped viruses acquire their envelope from host membranes
  - **Cell lysis**: non-enveloped viruses are released by breaking the host cell
- **Examples**:
  - *Adenovirus*: release via cell lysis
  - *Retrovirus*: budding from the plasma membrane

## Example of reverse transcriptase virus

This video demonstrates how reverse transcriptase converts viral RNA into DNA, a crucial step in retroviral replication that also serves as an important antiviral drug target.

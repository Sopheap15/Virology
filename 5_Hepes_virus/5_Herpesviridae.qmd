## Objectives

After this session the students should be able to:

- List the main characteristics and morphology of HSV
- Describe the stages of HSV multiplication
- Explain the routes of HSV transmission
- Identify target organs and types of HSV infection
- Summarize the clinical manifestations of HSV infection
- Outline diagnostic techniques and treatment options for HSV


## Characteristics of HSV

- Icosahedral capsid (162 capsomers, 6 proteins) 
- Envelope with glycoproteins
- The genome: large, linear, double-stranded DNA (~152 kbp, high GC content), encoding ~80 proteins
- Ubiquitous but sensitive to acid, solvents, detergents, and drying
- Family: Herpesviridae, subfamily: Alphaherpesvirinae, genus: Simplexvirus
- HSV-1 (oral, above the waist) and HSV-2 (genital, below the waist)

## Multiplication

- In vitro: HSV infects permissive cells (human diploid, monkey kidney, amniotic fluid)
- In vivo: lytic infection in fibroblasts/epithelial cells; latent infection in neurons
- Entry: Glycoproteins bind glycosaminoglycans, fuse membranes, uncoat at nuclear pore
- Viral gene expression occurs in 3 phases:
  - Immediate early (α): gene regulation
  - Early (β): replication proteins
  - Late (γ): structural proteins

## Epidemiology {.smaller}

- **Reservoir:** humans are the only natural host
- **Disease/viral factors:**
  - HSV establishes lifelong latency after initial infection
  - Reactivation leads to recurrent disease and continued transmission
  - Asymptomatic viral shedding is common and contributes to spread
- **Transmission:**
  - Direct contact with mucosal surfaces or broken skin
  - Spread via saliva, genital secretions, or contact with lesion fluid
  - Transmission occurs through oral, genital, ocular routes, and skin abrasions
  - HSV-1 is primarily transmitted orally; HSV-2 is mainly transmitted sexually, but both can infect either site

## Epidemiology

- **Who is at risk?**
  - Children: primary HSV-1 infection (oral, mucosal, ocular)
  - Sexually active adults: primary HSV-2 infection (genital)
  - Healthcare workers (physicians, nurses, dentists): risk of herpetic whitlow from contact with oral/genital secretions
  - Immunocompromised individuals and neonates: increased risk for severe, disseminated, or life-threatening HSV disease

## Pathogenesis

- **Acute Infection:**  
  - HSV infects mucoepithelial cells, causing local lytic infection and inflammation
  - Virus spreads to sensory neurons and ganglia (trigeminal for HSV-1, sacral for HSV-2)

- **Latent Infection:**  
  - HSV remains dormant in sensory ganglia
  - Reactivation (triggered by stress, immunosuppression, etc.) causes recurrent lesions at the original site

## Pathogenesis (cont.)

![](images/image10.png){ width=100%  style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"}

## Immunity

**Innate immunity:** interferons and natural killer (NK) cells help control early HSV infection  
**Cell-mediated immunity:** T helper 1 (TH1) and cytotoxic T cells (CD8+) destroy infected cells and are essential for recovery  
**Antibody response:** antibodies neutralize free virus and limit its spread, but do not eliminate latent virus  
**Immunopathology:** immune response causes inflammation and symptoms  
**Immunodeficiency:** people with weak immune systems may have severe, recurrent, or widespread HSV infections

## Clinical manifestations: HSV-1 {.smaller}
:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="70%"}
- **Young children:** gingivostomatitis (painful oral ulcers, fever, feeding difficulties)
- **Adults:** pharyngitis or tonsillitis
- **Skin lesions:** vesicular eruptions that progress to ulcers, commonly around mouth and face
- **Systemic symptoms:** fever, malaise, myalgia
- **Other findings:** cervical lymphadenopathy

## Clinical manifestations: HSV-2
:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
- **Genital herpes:** painful vesiculo-ulcerative lesions on external genitalia, perineum, or anus
- **Lesion progression:** vesicles → pustules → ulcers
- **Systemic symptoms:** fever, malaise, myalgia
- **Other findings:** dysuria, inguinal lymphadenopathy

- **Ocular infection:**  
  - Primarily caused by HSV-1 (except in neonates, where HSV-2 may be involved)
  - Keratoconjunctivitis: infection of the cornea and conjunctiva
  - Symptoms: pre-auricular lymphadenopathy, photophobia, eyelid edema, tearing (lacrimation)
  - Retinitis: may develop years after initial infection
  - HSV is a leading cause of infectious blindness due to corneal or retinal involvement

## Diagnostic virus isolation

- **Virus isolation (cell culture):** gold standard for HSV diagnosis
- **Sample:** collect from active lesions (vesicle fluid, swab)
- **Cell lines:** Vero cells, human fibroblasts
- **Cytopathic effects:** syncytia, ballooning cytoplasm, Cowdry type A inclusions
- **Limitations:** needs specialized lab and viable virus

## Additional diagnostic methods {.smaller}

- **Immunological tests:** detect viral antigens (immunofluorescence, EIA); rapid but less sensitive than PCR
- **Serology:** detects IgM (recent) and IgG (past) antibodies; differentiates HSV-1/HSV-2; useful for primary infection and epidemiology
- **PCR:** highly sensitive for HSV DNA; preferred for neurological cases; does not confirm infectivity

## Diagnostic virology

![](images/image24.png){ width=70% }

## Diagnostic virology summary {.smaller}

- **Primary infection:** viral isolation or serology (IgM/IgG)
- **Encephalitis:** PCR of CSF (most sensitive)
- **Retinitis:** PCR of ocular fluids
- **Pregnancy:** viral culture if no HSV history
- **Neonates:** culture or PCR from lesions/blood/CSF

*PCR is preferred for neurological/ocular cases; serology helps differentiate HSV-1 vs. HSV-2.*

## Treatment

- **Acyclovir (acycloguanosine):** a guanine analog that selectively inhibits HSV DNA synthesis
- **Other antivirals:** valacyclovir and famciclovir are oral prodrugs with improved bioavailability, used for HSV infections
- **Mechanism:** these drugs block viral DNA polymerase, preventing viral replication and spread
- **Resistance:** may occur in immunocompromised patients due to mutations in thymidine kinase or DNA polymerase

![](images/image25.png){ width=70% }

## Treatment guidelines

- **Initial episode (genital herpes):** oral acyclovir, valacyclovir, or famciclovir for 7–10 days
- **Recurrent episodes:** short-course therapy (1–5 days) at symptom onset
- **Severe or disseminated infection:** intravenous acyclovir
- **Ocular or CNS involvement:** prompt IV acyclovir is essential
- **Neonatal HSV:** IV acyclovir for 14–21 days

*Treatment duration may be extended if healing is incomplete after 10 days.*

## Prevention

- No vaccine available
- Avoid contact with active lesions or secretions
- Practice safe sex (condoms)
- Do not share personal items
- Screen pregnant women; give antivirals if needed
- Treat at-risk newborns with acyclovir

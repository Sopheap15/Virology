# HEPATITIS A VIRUS

## Overview

- Acute hepatitis by HAV (_Picornaviridae_, Hepatovirus)
- Fecal–oral spread: contaminated food/water, shellfish, close contact
- Incubation 15–50 days (≈25); children often asymptomatic
- Dx: anti‑HAV IgM (acute); IgG = past infection/vaccine
- 99% of healthy adults self-limiting, develop lifelong immunity
- Prevention: hygiene, immune globulin post‑exposure, inactivated vaccine

## Structure{.font14}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="65%"}
- Virion: non-enveloped, icosahedral, ~27 nm
- Genome: +ssRNA (~7.5 kb) with VPg at 5′ and poly(A) tail at 3′
- Expression: single ORF → polyprotein, cleaved into structural (VP1–VP4) and nonstructural proteins
- Environmental stability: acid- and solvent-resistant; persists in water/food; inactivated by chlorination, adequate heat (>60 °C), formalin, or UV

## Replication {.font14}

:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="60%"}
- Receptor: TIM‑1 (HAVCR1) on hepatocytes
- Entry: receptor‑mediated endocytosis → uncoating in endosome
- Genome: +ssRNA (~7.5 kb, VPg‑linked) — serves as mRNA
- Translation/replication: single ORF → polyprotein → proteolytic cleavage
- Assembly/release: cytoplasmic capsid assembly; released non‑enveloped

## Pathogenesis

![](images/image7.png){ width=100% style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border-radius: 8px;"}

## Pathogenesis and immunity
- Entry: ingestion → replicates in oropharyngeal/intestine → primary viremia → hepatocytes/Kupffer cells
- Liver injury: immune‑mediated (T cells); minimal direct cytopathic effect
- Shedding: high fecal viral load ~10–14 days before jaundice; peaks at symptom onset
- Immunity: anti‑HAV IgM in acute, replaced by durable IgG → lifelong immunity
- Outcome: usually self‑limited (incubation ~15–50 days); fulminant hepatitis rare (~0.1%)

## Epidemiology

- Reservoir: humans (chimpanzees experimentally susceptible)
- Distribution: worldwide; highest where sanitation is poor
- Risk factors: poor sanitation, contaminated food/water, crowded settings, travel
- Outcomes/immunity: usually self‑limited; fulminant disease rare; anti‑HAV IgG = long‑lasting immunity

## Clinical syndromes 

- Most infections are asymptomatic, especially in children
- Incubation/shedding: 15–50 days (mean ~25); fecal shedding peaks ~1–2 weeks before symptoms
- Adults: abrupt onset of fever, fatigue, nausea, anorexia, and abdominal pain; jaundice in ~70–80%
- Children (<6 years): usually mild or asymptomatic; jaundice ≈10%
- Course: symptoms intensify for several days before the icteric phase; ~99% recover, fulminant hepatitis is rare (~0.1%)

## Clinical syndromes

![](images/image8.png){ width=100% style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border-radius: 8px;" }

## Laboratory diagnosis

- Anti‑HAV IgM (EIA/ELISA) — indicates acute/recent infection
- Anti‑HAV IgG — past infection or vaccine‑induced immunity
- HAV RNA (RT‑PCR, stool or serum) — early detection and outbreak/genotyping
- Specimens: serum/plasma for serology; stool or serum for PCR

## Treatment, prevention, and control

- Treatment: supportive care — rest, fluids, nutrition
- Prevent fecal–oral spread: safe water and food, hand hygiene, avoid raw shellfish
- Water: boil or chlorinate to inactivate HAV
- Post‑exposure: immune globulin within 2 weeks
- Vaccination: inactivated vaccine, recommended for travelers and high‑risk groups


# HEPATITIS B VIRUS

![](images/image15.png){ width=320px .absolute right=300px}


## Pathogenesis and immunity {.font14}

- Outcomes: asymptomatic, acute, or chronic disease
- Transmission: blood, sexual, perinatal; virus present in various body fluids
- Liver injury: immune‑mediated; HBV itself is minimally cytopathic
- Incubation: weeks–months (≈90 days); cccDNA persistence enables latency
- Clearance requires strong multispecific CD4+/CD8+ responses + anti‑HBs; weak/tolerant responses → chronicity
- Chronic sequelae: fibrosis, cirrhosis, HCC; HBeAg/HBsAg indicate high replication

## Pathogenesis and immunity {.font14}

- Acute: hepatocellular swelling
- Infiltrate: lymphocytes with Kupffer cell activation
- Injury: immune‑mediated cytotoxic T cell killing, minimal direct viral cytopathy
- Resolution: strong CD4+/CD8+ responses and anti‑HBs → viral clearance and regeneration
- Chronicity: weak/tolerant immunity → persistent infection, fibrosis, cirrhosis, ↑ HCC risk
- Markers: HBeAg and high HBV DNA = active replication; HBsAg loss and anti‑HBs = recovery

## Pathogenesis

![](images/image16.png){ width=100% style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border-radius: 8px;" }

## Epidemiology{.font14}

- Global burden: ~296 million chronically infected; ~820,000 deaths/year
- Highest prevalence: sub‑Saharan Africa, East/Southeast Asia, Amazon, Pacific Islands
- Main transmission routes: perinatal (mother→infant), early‑childhood, sexual contact, percutaneous exposures (blood, unsafe injections, IDU)
- High‑risk groups: infants of HBsAg+ mothers, people from endemic regions, people who inject drugs, MSM, healthcare workers, hemodialysis/transfusion recipients
- Key controls: timely birth‑dose and routine infant vaccination, maternal screening + antivirals in pregnancy, safe blood/injection practices, harm‑reduction services


## Clinical syndromes for acute infection {.font14}
- Incubation: prolonged (weeks–months); often insidious onset
- Prodrome: fever, malaise, anorexia → nausea, vomiting, abdominal discomfort, myalgias
- Icteric phase: jaundice, dark urine, pale stools, pruritus
- Course: severity variable; adults more often symptomatic than children
- Fulminant hepatitis: rare (~1%) — acute liver failure with encephalopathy, coagulopathy, ascites, and bleeding
- Immune‑complex–mediated extrahepatic manifestations: rash, arthralgia/polyarthritis, serum‑sickness–like illness, necrotizing vasculitis, and glomerulonephritis

## Clinical syndrom for chronic infection (cont.) {.font14}
- Progression: ~5–10% of adult infections become chronic; much higher after perinatal exposure
- Clinical states:
  - Inactive carrier: HBsAg positive with low/undetectable HBV DNA and normal ALT — minimal ongoing liver injury
  - Chronic active hepatitis: persistent inflammation → progressive fibrosis, cirrhosis, liver failure
- Complications: cirrhosis and HCC. Mechanisms include chronic inflammation and occasional viral DNA integration into the host genom
- Latency to HCC: highly variable (reported ≈9–35 years or longer)

## Pathogenesis and immunity {.font14}

- Invades B and T lymphocytes and monocytes then infects hepatocytes
- Promotes cell survival leading to persistent infection
- Cell-mediated immunity mediates viral clearance and liver injury
- Chronic infection exhausts CD8 T cells and impairs viral elimination
- Histology shows inflammation, portal and periportal fibrosis, and lobular necrosis
- Chronic inflammation and regeneration increase hepatocellular carcinoma risk
- Anti-HCV antibodies are not protective

## Epidemiology

- Transmission: bloodborne, sexual
- High risk: people who inject drugs, transfusion/organ recipients, tattoo recipients, hemophiliacs
- Global burden: ~58 million chronically infected, ~350k deaths/year

## Clinical syndromes

- Acute: often asymptomatic; ~15% clear infection
- Chronic: ~70–80% progress to chronic infection with risk of cirrhosis and HCC
- Common symptom: persistent fatigue

## Diagnosis, treatment and prevention

- Anti‑HCV antibody screening, confirm with HCV RNA by RT-PCR
- Use viral load for treatment monitoring

- Direct‑acting antivirals (E.g Glecaprevir) achieve cure in >90% of cases
- Prevent: blood screening, harm reduction (needle programs), safe tattooing, avoid alcohol

- Defective satellite virus requiring HBsAg for assembly and spread
- Relies on HBV for envelope and hepatocyte entry
- Encodes one protein and depends on host enzymes for replication

## Structure and replication {.font14}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="65%"}
- Genome: circular negative ssRNA ~1700 nt forming rodlike structure by base pairing
- Virion: ~35–37 nm, delta Ag core wrapped by HBsAg envelope
- Delta antigen: small 24 kDa and large 27 kDa forms with distinct roles
- Replication: host RNA polymerase II transcribes genome, ribozyme cleavage, RNA editing generates large delta Ag for packaging
:::
:::{.column width="35%"}
![](images/image29.png){ width=100% style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border-radius: 8px;" }
:::
:::

## Pathogenesis

- Occurs only with HBV coinfection or superinfection
- Superinfection of chronic HBV often causes more severe and rapidly progressive liver disease
- Liver injury from direct cytopathic effects of HDV plus immune mediated damage

![](images/image30.png){ width=70% style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border-radius: 8px;" }

## Diagnosis

- HDV RNA by RT‑PCR or anti‑HDV antibodies by ELISA
- Test patients with acute or severe HBV disease and chronic HBV carriers with worsening liver injury

## Treatment and prevention

- No widely approved specific antiviral for HDV in many regions
- Manage underlying HBV and refer to hepatology for emerging therapies and trials
- Prevent HDV by HBV vaccination and blood safety measures

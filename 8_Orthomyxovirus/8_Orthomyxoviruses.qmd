## Introduction{.font14}

- Family: Orthomyxoviridae — main human pathogens: Influenza A & B (C milder)
- Virion: enveloped, negative‑sense segmented RNA (A/B: 8 segments)
- Surface proteins: HA (attachment/fusion) and NA (sialic‑acid cleavage for release)
- Hosts/transmission: birds/swine/humans; spread by droplets/aerosols; peaks in cool months
- Clinical: upper → lower respiratory disease
- Control: annual vaccination, neuraminidase inhibitors

## Structure {.smaller}

- Virion: pleomorphic — spherical or filamentous; diameter ≈ 80–120nm

- Envelope: lipid bilayer with two major surface glycoproteins 

- Surface proteins
  - Hemagglutinin (HA): binds sialic‑acid receptors and mediates membrane fusion
  - Neuraminidase (NA): cleaves sialic acid to facilitate release from cells

- Genome: segmented –ssRNA

- Internal proteins
  - NP: encapsidates viral RNA and contributes to host/type specificity
  - M1: matrix protein that organizes virion structure and promotes assembly/budding
  - M2: proton channel involved in uncoating and viral release

## Replication{.font14}

- Attachment: HA binds sialic‑acid receptors on respiratory epithelial cells
- Entry: receptor‑mediated endocytosis; endosomal acidification triggers membrane fusion
- Uncoating: M2 proton channel and low pH release ribonucleoproteins to the cytoplasm and nucleus
- Transcription: viral polymerase (PA/PB1/PB2) cap‑snatches host mRNA to synthesize viral mRNAs
- Replication: full‑length (+)RNA intermediates serve as templates to make new (−)genomic segments in the nucleus
- Assembly & release: viral proteins assemble at the plasma membrane and bud (released ≈8 h)

## Pathogenesis & Immunity {.smaller}

- Tropism and damage
  - Infects upper and lower respiratory epithelium → epithelial death and impaired mucociliary clearance

- Innate immunity
  - Early control by type I IFNs, macrophages, and NK cells; cytokines cause systemic symptoms

- Adaptive immunity
  - CD8+ T cells clear infected cells; neutralizing anti‑HA/NA antibodies block infection

- Complications
  - Excessive inflammation worsens lung injury; epithelial damage predisposes to secondary bacterial infection (e.g., _S. pneumoniae_, _S. aureus_).

- Antigenic variation
  - Drift → seasonal epidemics; shift → potential pandemics → vaccines require periodic updates

## Epidemiology

- Viral/host: Influenza A — multiple hosts and pandemic potential; Influenza B — mainly human. Virus more stable in cool, low‑humidity conditions
- Transmission: respiratory droplets/aerosols (small aerosols can reach lower airways); infectious ~1 day before to ~5–7 days after symptoms; fomites possible
- Who's at risk: ≥65 years, young children, pregnant people, immunocompromised, chronic disease, long‑term care residents

## Epidemiology (cont.)

## Clinical manifestations {.font14}

- Incubation: 1–4 days
- Typical: fever, chills, myalgia, headache, malaise, anorexia; sore throat, dry cough, nasal symptoms
- Course: fever 3–5 days; cough and fatigue may persist 1–2+ weeks
- Age notes: children — more bronchiolitis/otitis; elderly — atypical presentation, less fever, higher complication risk; pregnancy/chronic disease — increased severity
- Complications: primary viral pneumonia, secondary bacterial pneumonia
- Warning signs: severe dyspnea or hypoxia, chest pain, hemoptysis, persistent high fever, altered mental status, dehydration, rapid deterioration or no improvement after 48–72 h

## Treatment, Prevention, and Control {.font14}

- Antivirals
  - Neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, zanamivir): most effective if started within 48 h; prioritize severe/high‑risk/hospitalized patients
  - Baloxavir: single‑dose option; resistance can occur
  - Adamantanes (amantadine, rimantadine): not recommended due to widespread resistance

- Vaccination
  - Annual vaccine (IIV, LAIV, recombinant), usually quadrivalent; routine ≥6 months, high priority for older adults, pregnant people, healthcare workers, and those with chronic conditions.

## Treatment, Prevention, and Control {.font14}

- Infection control
  - Hand hygiene, masking, isolation/cohorting in healthcare
  - Antiviral prophylaxis for selected exposed high‑risk individuals or to control institutional outbreaks

- Surveillance
  - Ongoing monitoring of antigenic drift/shift and antiviral resistance to inform vaccine composition and treatment

## Objectives

After this session the students should be able to:

- Demonstrate the importance of diagnosis in virology
- Identify the laboratory procedure for diagnosis in virology
- Explain the cell culture to identify virus in medical laboratory
- Describe the techniques that detect viral protein to identify virus in medical laboratory

## Case vignette

A 28-year-old woman presents with fever, fatigue, and a rash. These symptoms appeared two days ago.
She recently returned from a tropical vacation.

👉 **Task**:
Work in groups to diagnose the possible illness and suggest appropriate laboratory tests to confirm the diagnosis.


::: {.notes}
Prompt discussion on differential diagnosis: Ask students to consider possible viral causes (e.g., dengue, measles, Zika, chikungunya, rubella). Guide them to think about which laboratory tests would be most appropriate based on symptoms, travel history, and timing—such as PCR for viral genome detection, serology for antibody response, and antigen detection assays. Emphasize the importance of specimen collection timing and clinical context in selecting diagnostic methods.
:::

## Introduction {.smaller}

- Why diagnostics matter:
  - Enable timely, targeted treatment and infection control
  - Inform public-health responses, surveillance, and outbreak investigation

- What diagnostic methods can do:
  - Detect virus directly (particles, antigens, genomes)
  - Isolate and grow virus for characterization (culture)
  - Measure host response (antibodies) for retrospective diagnosis or immunity assessment
  - Quantify viral load and identify variants (qPCR, sequencing)

## Introduction (cont.)
- Key challenges in viral diagnosis:
  - Timing of specimen collection and specimen quality affect sensitivity
  - Viral diversity and low loads can reduce detection rates

## Specimen collection:

- Choose specimens based on suspected virus and clinical presentation
- Collect samples early in the acute phase for highest viral yield
- Antibody response may interfere with virus detection—timing is critical
- Use proper transport media with antibiotics and proteins to preserve sample integrity
- Keep specimens cold (usually 2-8°C) and process promptly to ensure accurate results

::: {.notes}
Proper specimen collection is the first critical step in viral diagnostics. Emphasize the importance of timing and handling to maintain sample viability.

## Diagnosis technique (cont.)

![](images/image9.png){ width=100% style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"}

::: {.notes}
Here we see the four main groups of diagnostic techniques: morphological, immunological, molecular, and serological. Each has its strengths for different viruses.
:::

## Diagnosis technique (cont.)

Key laboratory procedures:

- Cytologic examination
- Electron microscopy
- Virus isolation and culture
- Antigen/protein detection (immunoassays)
- Genome detection (PCR / sequencing)
- Serology (antibodies / antigens)

::: {.notes}
Introduce the four broad approaches—morphology, culture, immunologic and molecular—then mention trade-offs (speed vs sensitivity vs specificity) and when each is preferred.
:::


## Electron microscopy

- Direct visualization of viral particles using negative staining
- Useful for detecting non-culturable viruses (e.g., _Rotavirus_)
- Sensitivity increased with virus-specific antibodies
- Limited routine use; mainly for rapid identification

## Cell culture {.smaller}

- To grow and isolate virus from clinical specimens
- To observer cytopathic effects (CPE)
- To identify, quantify, and characterize viruses
- To produce live attenuated vaccines

| **Type**                         | **Source & Characteristics**                                                                 | **Typical Uses**                        | **Lifespan**               |
|:----------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------|:---------------------------|
| **Primary Cell Culture**          | Directly isolated from animal or human tissue; closely resemble normal cells                | Virus isolation, vaccine production      | Short (few divisions)      |
| **Diploid Cell Line**             | Derived from normal cells; maintain diploid chromosome number; limited subcultures          | Diagnostic assays, research              | Moderate (20–50 divisions) |

## Detection of viral proteins

- Enzymes and other proteins -> detected by biochemical, immunologic, and molecular biology
- Viral proteins -> separated by electrophoresis -> identify and distinguish different viruses

- Monoclonal or monospecific antibodies -> distinguishing viruses (antigens on cell surface or within cell) -> detected by immunofluorescence and enzyme immunoassay (EIA).

- Virus or antigen released from infected cells -> detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and latex agglutination (LA).

::: {.notes}
Viral proteins can be detected through various immunological and biochemical methods. Antibodies play a key role in these assays.
:::

## Detection of viral proteins

Technique:

- Protein patterns (electrophoresis)
- Enzyme activities (e.g., reverse transcriptase)
- Hemagglutination and hemadsorption
- Antigen detection (e.g., direct and indirect immunofluorescence, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay)

::: {.notes}
Specific techniques for protein detection include electrophoresis for patterns and assays like ELISA for antigens.
:::

## Detection of viral genetic material

Modern molecular techniques for detecting viral genetic material:

- **PCR & RT-PCR:** amplify and detect viral DNA/RNA
- **qPCR:** quantifies viral load
- **Electrophoresis:** analyzes RNA/DNA size and segments
- **Blotting (Southern/Northern):** identifies specific viral genes
- **Genome sequencing:** comprehensive virus identification

::: {.notes}
Speaker note: Emphasize that molecular methods are frontline for many viruses—fast and sensitive—but require strict controls to avoid contamination. Mention clinical uses: diagnosis, viral load monitoring, and variant detection.

:::

## Serology testing

- Identify viruses: hard to culture or cause long-lasting diseases
- Helps distinguish between acute, chronic, primary, or recurrent infections by measuring antibody levels
- Detects antibodies against viral proteins, especially later in infection
- Common serologic tests include neutralization, hemagglutination inhibition (HI),
indirect fluorescent antibody, latex agglutination, ELISA, and Western blot
